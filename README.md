# Features

World is infinite in all dimensions: No end in horizon nor is there a bottom or top

Realistic moon cycle of phases. Game starts during an annular eclipse thanks to my jealousy of those watching the 2024 totality, during which I took my physics exam.

Day/Night cycle: The Sun causes light to change throughout the day.

Light levels: Two light levels: sky and block. Sky light level comes in columns from the sky, while block light level comes from luminous blocks. Currently, only sun stone is luminous, which is found frequently at depths of 30 or greater.

Entites: when the player mines a block, an item drops as an entity, which is rendered based on the chunk the item is in.
